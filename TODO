* Abtract to N dimensions.

* Filter points outside the specified dimensions.

* Use pipelining to send all the ZRANGEBYLEX queries.

* Some way to support pipelined add of multiple points.
  Perhaps just r.pipelined { idex.add(...) } ?

* For queries with very unbalanced dimensions spawn (for example querying
  a rectangle from 10,10, to 1000,11), it may be good to perform some
  sampling to check density of points in order to better adapt the
  query bits size.
