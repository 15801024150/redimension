* Some way to support pipelined add of multiple points.
  Perhaps just r.pipelined { idex.add(...) } works?

* Select a better exponent for the query by using ZLEXCOUNT to estimate
  if filtering work would be too big or not to perform compared to the
  number of additional queries.

* Implement unindex and unindex by ID methods with Hash mapping.
